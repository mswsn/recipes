- üç≥ Cook time: 35 min
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 2

## Ingredients

- 1.5 dl cooked rice
- 1/2 package tempeh
- 2 cloves garlic
- Soy sauce
- 3 dl chopped kale
- 2 leeks
- Sugar
- Olive oil
- 1 tbsp crunchy peanut butter
- 1 tsp hot sauce
- 0.5 tsp dried basil
- Koriander
- Sesame seeds
- Red pepper flakes
- Black pepper

## Directions

1. While the Rice is cooking, finely chop the Kale and set aside in a bowl. Cube the Tempeh, chop the Garlic, and slice the Leeks.

2. Over medium heat in a skillet, heat the copped Garlic in a drizzle of Olive Oil until it gets fragrant. Add the Tempeh cubes and let them get brown and crispy. Squeeze in your soy sauce and let it all soak up. Scoot the Tempeh to one side, add more Olive Oil and throw in the Leeks with a generous pinch of sugar. Let the Leeks caramelize and get golden around the edges.

3. Meanwhile, in a small bowl combine Peanut Butter, Hot Sauce, Basil, a pinch of Sugar and a couple drops of soy sauce. Slowly add boiling water to your mixture until you reach your desired consistency.

4. When the Rice has finished cooking, serve in a bowl with the Kale, Tempeh and Leeks. Drizzle on that hot Peanut Butter sauce, garnish with Cilantro, and sprinkle on a little bit of of Sesame Seeds, Red Pepper Flakes and Cracked Black Pepper to taste.
