# Creamy mushroom pasta
Quick recipe I [found](https://www.reddit.com/r/15minutefood/comments/f38xar/creamy_garlic_mushroom_tagliatelle/fhh65s8/) that works great with many types of pasta.
 
- 🍳 Cook time: 15 mins
- 🍽️ Servings: 2

## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 250 g chestnut mushrooms
- 250 g pasta
- 3 cloves garlic
- 1 tbsp butter
- 2 tbsp cream cheese
- 75 ml milk
- 50 g parmesan-style cheese
- Salt
- Black pepper
- Few sprigs fresh parsley

## Directions

1. Slice the mushrooms.
2. Heat a dash of oil in a frying pan, and add the mushrooms. Cook over a medium heat for 5 minutes, until fairly soft.
3. While the mushrooms are cooking, boil the pasta in plenty of water until cooked al dente.
4. When the mushrooms are fairly soft, add the garlic and the butter. Cook for a few more minutes until the garlic is fragrant and the mushrooms have started to turn golden brown.
5. Lower the heat, and add the cream cheese, milk, and grated cheese. Add a generous pinch of salt and pepper, as well as the chopped parsley. Cook gently for a few minutes, until the cheese melts to create a smooth, glossy sauce.
6. When the sauce is hot, add the cooked pasta, and toss to coat. You can add a dash more milk if the sauce seems too thick. Serve immediately topped with more parsley and grated parmesan.
